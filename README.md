# ACL Anthology Corpus - Full Text 📚
This repository provides full-text and metadata to the ACL anthology collection including .pdf files and grobid extractions of the pdfs.

## How is this different from what ACL anthology provides? 
We are also providing full-text, references and other details extracted by grobid from the PDFs. If you just want abstracts please visit - [acl anthology](https://aclanthology.org/anthology+abstracts.bib.gz) 


----

The goal is to keep this repo updated and a comprehensive repository of the full ACL collection.

This repository provides - 
1. 📖 All PDFs in ACL anthology -  `80,015`
2. 🏷️ Raw grobid extraction results on all the ACL anthology pdfs which includes full text and references [TODO]
3. 💾 CSV file with metadata and full text of the collection for analysis 

TODO:
1. Link the acl corpus to semantic scholar(S2). Folks can then use the S2 API to get more data.
2. Extract figures and captions from the ACL corpus using pdffigures.
3. Have a release schedule to keep the corpus updated.

We are hoping that this corpus can be helpful for analysis relevant to the ACL community.
